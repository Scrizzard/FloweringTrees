	For this week's Lightning Project we decided to use the Observer Pattern to keep Ursule and
Mireille (and other subscribers) up to date on which trees are in bloom. In the implementation the
subject of observations are Tree objects. Our TreeSubscriber and TreeCollector classes implement the
Observer interface. A TreeSubscriber object is created for a subscriber who wishes to receive updates
about the flowering status of particular tree(s). The TreeCollector class does the querying of trees for
their blooming status, updating the list of blooming trees and allowing trees to be added or removed
from the collection. 

	A design decision we had to consider for our Tree class was how to store the blooming times of
a particular tree. Originally we considered storing an array of 365 booleans where the values would be
true on days that are in its flowering range. Realizing there must have been a better way to implement
the blooming range for a flowering tree, we found and utilized the GregorianCalendar class.  This
provided a few advantages. GregorianCalendar fortunately does not require an array of length 365 to be
tediously filled with the correct boolean values. More importantly however, this allowed the flexibility
of specifying time of day for a blooming range. This feature might be important for certain trees and as
per the GregorianCalendar constructor time of day can be omitted if it is not needed.
