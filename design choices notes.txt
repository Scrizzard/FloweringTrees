how do we store blooming time ranges?
	-array of 365 booleans was rejected
	-we wanted the flexibility of blooming/unblooming at different times of day
	-easier to represent as ranges of time (start time/end time pairs)

why use the observer pattern?
	-because we have an observer, and we have things to observe, basically

how did we choose to represent trees?
	-as an observable base class
